<h2>Services</h2>
<p>I used to write code and train in psychoanalysis on the side. Now I combine my experiences into a unique offering.</p>
<h3>Assess and repair unproductive teams</h3>
<p>It happens much more often than anyone cares to admit: a previously productive development team slowly grinds to a halt. Factions form and lines are drawn. Every decision becomes a management nightmare. Key people begin to leave and it threatens the health of the entire product.</p>
<p>My services have a general outline:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assess the damage done by accumulated frustration and unacknowledged aggression. Interviews both with leaders and with overlooked staff fill in the story. No one version of the problem is allowed "official" status as I create a balanced, nuanced case history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mediate between embattled parties. Find the crux of the conflict and let it air out in a safe and respectful environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigate to what degree technical limitations are at play vs. psychological hindrances and neurotic compulsions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Form a plan of action and present it both to the entire team and management.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Train developers in emotional communication and the language of the unconscious</h3>
<p>Developers aren't paid to feel difficult feelings. Nor are they known for their ability to communicate with non-technical people. I offer training courses to help bridge these gaps.</p>
<p>My courses are taught in the language of computer science. I use data and experimental modeling to produce desired outcomes. I don't teach magic solutions to eternal problems. I facilitate communication and encourage emotional maturity.</p>
