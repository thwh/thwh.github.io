<h2>Background</h2>

<h2>Services</h2>
<p>I used to write code and train in psychoanalysis on the side. Now I combine my experiences into a unique offering.</p>

<h3>Assess and repair unproductive teams</h3>
<p>It happens much more often than anyone cares to admit: a previously productive development team slowly grinds to a halt. Factions form and lines are drawn. Every decision becomes a management nightmare. Key people begin to leave and it threatens the health of the entire product.</p>
<p>My services have a general outline:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Assess the damage done by accumulated frustration and unacknowledged aggression. Interviews both with leaders and with overlooked staff fill in the story. No one version of the problem is allowed "official" status as I create a balanced, nuanced case history.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Mediate between embattled parties. Find the crux of the conflict and let it air out in a safe and respectful environment.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Help the team heal and find the joy of working together again. Facilitate training courses as needed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Train developers in emotional communication</h3>
<p>Developers aren't paid to feel difficult feelings. Nor are they known for their ability to communicate with non-technical people. I offer training courses to help bridge these gaps.</p>
<p>My courses are taught in the language of computer science. I use data and
  experimental modeling to produce desired outcomes. I don't teach magic
  solutions to eternal problems. I facilitate communication and encourage
  emotional maturity. I introduce developers to the power of a therapeutic attitude toward the unconscious.</p>
